# Intro

The initial goal of this project is to try Cypress driven development. This is achieved by following these guidelines:

- Cypress tests are written before work for a feature is started
- no manual testing - should be covered by Cypress

# Get started

- clone the project & `cd` into it
- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev` to open the development server & cypress
- write the Cypress tests
- make them pass

## About `yarn dev`

This command starts the development server, which will reload when the `src` files change. It also opens the Cypress app, which allows quickly running a specific test.

# What are we coding?

The app being developed is a turn-based strategy game, similar to:
